Fake IP Go-nerator (GUI edition)
================================

A simple fake IPv4 generator written in Go, with a basic GUI made in the [Fyne toolkit][1]

Compiling
---------

See the Fyne docs for a list of [stuff you need to install to build this app][2]. If you are on Linux and have [Nix][3] installed, you can instead just run `nix develop` and you will get a shell with all dependencies available

Once that is done just run this:

```sh
go build -v
```

Why
-------

Why not? :)

I'm learning programming, and there is no better way to do it than by actually writing code (though admittedly I don't do it enough)
